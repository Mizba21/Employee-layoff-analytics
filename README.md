# Employee Layoff Analytics

## Motivation
The involuntary removal of employees through layoffs, often driven by economic and financial pressures, has become a growing issue across industries. Mass layoffs, especially in the tech sector, have surged post-pandemic due to over-hiring, cost pressures, and funding challenges. Data analytics can play a pivotal role in understanding and preventing layoffs by assessing employee performance and identifying areas of inefficiency or redundancy. Machine learning techniques can also offer insights into potential alternatives, like reassigning staff or improving employee skills to avoid layoffs. Ultimately, thoughtful use of data can mitigate the negative impacts of layoffs on both employees and businesses.
